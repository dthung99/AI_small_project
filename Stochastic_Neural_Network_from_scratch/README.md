# Stochastic_Neural_Network_from_scratch
Aim: building a Stochastic Neural Network for classifing MNIST dataset.

Method: 2 approaches were tried 
+ Monte Carlo sampling: Dropout layers that are active in both train and test were used: DONE
+ Variational inference backpropagation approach: FAILED: I might misunderstand the math. I'll come back later.
