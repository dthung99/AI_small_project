# WGAN_from_scratch
Aim: building a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) with gradient penalty for MNIST dataset.

Method: The network train the discriminator to maximize and generator to minimize the Wasserstein distance. Gradient Penalty help the discriminator output do not skyrocket to infinity.
