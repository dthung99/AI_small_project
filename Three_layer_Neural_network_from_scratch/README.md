# Three_layer_Neural_network_from_scratch
The project include:
+ Building 2 neural network with softmax multi-class classifier
+ Solving backpropagation by hand using multivariable chain rule and code it using only Numpy.

The architecture of the 2 neural networks:
+ 2 layer: 1 input layer, 1 output layer: 14x3
+ 3 layer: 1 input layer, 1 hidden layer, 1 output layer: 14x14x3

Main achievement:
+ Understanding the math, being able to solve it by hand
+ Accuracy >98% for test set
