# Three_layer_Neural_network_from_scratch

The project include building 2 softmax multi-class classifier by solving backpropagation using multivariable chain (with pens and papers), and code the math using only Numpy.
+ 2 layer: 1 input layer, 1 output layer: 14x3
+ 3 layer: 1 input layer, 1 output layer: 14x14x3

Main points:
- Math are solved by hand and coded using Numpy
- Data used are from scikit-learn
