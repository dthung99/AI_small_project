# Resnet_from_scratch
Aim: building a Resnet classification model for MNIST dataset.

Method:
+ Building a Resnet model with 4 residual layer, each one has 3 residual block with the first block downsampling and increasing the number of channels.
+ Loss function: cross entropy loss.

Result:
+ Accuracy >99%.

Note: 1/4 of the code was adapted from my lecture at university.
